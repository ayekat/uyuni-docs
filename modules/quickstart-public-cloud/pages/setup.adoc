= Setting up

This guide shows you the fastest way to get {productname} up and running in a public cloud using on-demand or BYOS services.
We have tested these instructions on Amazon EC2, Google Compute Engine, and Microsoft Azure, but they should work on other providers as well, with some variation.

[NOTE]
====
Public clouds provide {productname} under a Bring Your Own Subscription (BYOS) model.
This means that you must have {suse} product entitlements to use {productname}.
====

You need to start by logging in to your chosen public cloud provider, and launching a {productname} instance.

Depending on the public cloud you are using, you can usually locate the {productname} Server images by searching for ``suse manager``.
In EC2, you need to search within the Community AMIs.
In GCE and Azure, search the marketplace.



== Instance requirements

Select a public cloud instance type that meets the hardware requirements in xref:installation:pubcloud-requirements.adoc[].
